# Picture-Project
This is a GUI application I created back in mid-year 2021 for a high school project. In order to access it, download the folder and go to the src/CopsnRobbers.java file and run that class in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ or Eclipse).

This was my first creative Java program. Although it extends a superclass which does the work of implementing all the interfaces for a Java Swing GUI to work for my class, it was fun to learn how to program a GUI for the first time.


# Goal of the game:
- Capture the red piece within 25 moves so that the red piece cannot move anymore

- In order to move a piece, click a blue piece and click one of its adjacent highlighted yellow squares to move it

(You can see the red piece moves too for every move you make)

- If you wish to cancel a move, click anything else on the board other than the adjacent highlighted yellow square

- Have fun! Hope you manage to capture the red piece!
